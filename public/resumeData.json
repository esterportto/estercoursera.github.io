        "bio": "My name is Ester, I'm 23 years old, and I currently work as a Junior Software Engineer at John Deere. In 2018, I graduated as a computer technician, and I'm currently in the 10th semester of Computer Engineering at Unisal-Campinas. With over 6 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies. My primary focus has always been front-end development, where I specialized in creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm proficient in popular frameworks and libraries like React. I've always loved working on the front-end because it allows me to blend my creativity with problem-solving skills to deliver exceptional user experiences. About a year ago, I had a significant opportunity to return to John Deere, but this time with new challenges outside of the front-end. Currently, I'm diving into the world of SAP PP and advancing my career as an ABAP programmer. I'm excited to expand my skill set and explore new areas in the field of software engineering. I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn and overcome challenges! üíúüí™üèª",
